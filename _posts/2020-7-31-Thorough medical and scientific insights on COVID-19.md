The site presents statistics, epidemiology, as well as other clinical information such as diagnostic methods and therapeutics. The site's weekly newsletters contain reviews and opinions by experts on relevant areas on recent clinical and basic studies on COVID-19 . The first newsletter, which was published on June 8th, contains an opinion article by professor Oh Myeong Don(SNU Hospital Deparment of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases), concerning a Remdesivir trial conducted by NIH on its use and effects on severe COVID-19 patients.

For more information head over to the [link](https://medicine.snu.ac.kr/en/node/25377). Very inconveniently, the SNU College of Medicine [main page](https://medicine.snu.ac.kr) does not have any direct links to the COVID-19 information page, so you might find the link useful.
